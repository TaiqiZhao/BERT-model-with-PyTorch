# BERT-model-with-PyTorch
This repository is part of [Stanford CS224N](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) course project. The project aims to improve the performance of multiple downstream NLP tasks by fine-tuning BERT embeddings. We also explore sophisticated processing in order to balance the improvement of the performance of these multiple downstream NLP tasks. \
\
The preliminary work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented minBERT model by conducting the downstream sentiment analysis task using the SST dataset and the CFIMDB dataset, employing both non-fine-tuning and fine-tuning processes on top of the pretrained minBERT model. Subsequently, our main work is to utilize the minBERT model across various downstream tasks in an optimal manner. To achieve this goal, several advanced strategies and state-of-the-art techniques are investigated and applied as extensions to our baseline model. As a result, our final best model demonstrates a significant improvement compared to the baseline.
